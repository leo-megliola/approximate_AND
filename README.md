# approximate_AND

This was my first attempt at function approximation using structure very similar to a neural net (uses weights). This was writen in 10th grade (2019). 

One of the main goals of this project was to create a deep understanding of the workings of ML techniques (neural nets in particular) without using libraries (numpy only).
